<h1>Board Highlighter</h1>

<p>This is a few simple utilities to automate the creation of electronic
kit assembly instructions, with automatic highlighting of the
components to use.</p>

<p>It requires numpy, scipy, and skimage to be installed to work.
This is kind of a bit much, but they're stuff I always have installed
and make the code much easier to knock out.</p>

<h2>Rough steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Run the ULP in EAGLE to get the board dump file. ("foo.dmp")</li>
<li>Save off a PNG of your board from EAGLE (File/Export) ("foo.png") </li>
<li>Run code/gen_steps.py foo.dmp > foo.json </li>
<li>Edit foo.json </li>
<ul>
    <li> Reorder steps as needed</li>
    <li> Add instructions in the "text" section </li>
    <li> Add a "tocheck": "Text for things to check" where needed
         (this is JSON, so mind your commas) </li>
    <li> Save and write out </li>
  </ul>
<li> Edit the web/steps.html.header and web/steps.html.footer as needed </li>
<li> Now run board_mask.py foo </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Click at your board's (0,0) when prompted to, to calibrate your image </li>
  <li> You can click multiple times to get an "average" of your point </li>
  <li> Close the window that pops up after you've clicked </li>
  <li> Repeat for the upper right corner of your board </li>
    </ul>
<li> You should have a bunch of images and foo_steps_base.html in your directory now </li>
<li> Touch up as needed and publish </li>
</ul>
